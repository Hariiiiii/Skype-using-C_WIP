This is a simple peer to peer chat application using C. Here we are trying to replicate skype functionality(except video calls).Currently group chat is not supported and the application is not stable, it is a work in progress and it will be stable within a week. Group chat feature will be added in the future.

Modules:

1. Authentication server(Multiprocess)
2. Supernode(Multithreaded)
3. Client/s

Functionality:

After the client is authenticated with the server, he will be able to register with one of the supernode of his/her choice.
Users could chat with other users by searching them through supernode and a direct communication channel is established between clients.
